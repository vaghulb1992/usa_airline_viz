# usa_airline_viz
Visualizations of United States airports, airlines and flight routes data using R Shiny and Leaflet in order to better understand the cancellation and delay metrics across different facets of air travel.

### Folder structure:-

**airportRouteAnalysis/**  
This folder contains the R Shiny app (using Leaflet). You can use `shinyRunner.R` to launch the applet.  

**airportRouteAnalysis/**  
This contains the code for generating the visualizations in order to study the delay metric for United airlines against its competitors. The powerpoint slide summarizes the info. In order to be able to run the code, you would have to download the dataset (http://rtricks4kids.ok.ubc.ca/wjbraun/DS550/air.csv) and save it in this folder so that the code can pick it up. You should then be able to run the code.
